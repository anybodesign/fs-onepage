# FS Onepage

A Gutenberg friendly WordPress Theme by Thomas Villain @ anybodesign.com

## Theme Options

### One Page

All your pages will be displayed on the front page and the main navigation menu will be automaticaly created. On click, menu items will scroll the page to their section.

It is recommanded that you set a front page and a page for posts.

You can sort your pages with the [Simple Custom Post Order](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-post-order/) plugin for example, or another one if you prefer.

### Carousel of posts

You can display all your posts as a carousel.

### Colors

You can set 3 different colors: 
* The primary one should be dark enough to support white text. 
* The secondary one will be used as background color for sections (with a low opacity) and color for links. 
* The contrast color can be used to style blocks in the new editor.

### Page templates

These page templates could be useful:
* Animated image: the featured image is set to 50% of the screen width and is slightly animated.
* Standalone page: with the one-page option set, this kind of page will not appear in the main navigation menu, but will link to another page.

## Menus

There are on navigation menu locations: _footer menu_ in the footer :)

## Widgets

There are two widgets area: one for the sidebar and one for the footer.
